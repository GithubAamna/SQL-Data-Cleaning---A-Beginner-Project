# SQL-Data-Cleaning---A-Beginner-Project
This repository contains the code and data for a Beginner SQL Data Cleaning Project focused on cleaning and preparing data for extensive exploratory data analysis. In this beginner project, a raw file containing information about layoffs by different companies from all over the world is cleaned and set up for further analysis.
The main purpose of this project was to understand the importance of Data Cleaning in the field of data analytics and familiarization with the entire process. This project utilized advanced SQL techniques to transform and cleanse data.

# Project Highlights
The main highlights of this projects were:
1) Data Wrangling: A thorough data wrangling process was conducted in order to prepare the available raw data for comprehensive future analysis,while maintaining data quality and relaibility.
2) Data Cleaning: A deep data cleaning process was performed using advanced SQL techniques i.e. JOINS, Common Table Expressions (CTE's) and many more. These techniques helped in data manipulation and transformation of data.
   Four basic steps were followed for data cleaning:
   * Removing Duplicates
   * Standardizing Data
   * Identifying NULL and Blank Values
   * Removing unwanted rows and columns
